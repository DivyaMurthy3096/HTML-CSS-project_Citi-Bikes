  <p> <center> <strong> Citi Bike, New York's bike-share system, has exploded in growth from 2013 when it first came on the city's transit map. As the system becomes more central to commuters, fleet maintenance and upkeep are top concerns.</strong> </center></p>

        <p>NYC’s bike-share program, Citi Bike, recently hit ridership records so high that it became the nation’s 25th largest public transit system, per Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit pushing for safer and equitable streets and urban design in New York). On Sept 9, 2022, 138,372 New Yorkers used a Citi Bike.</p>

      <p> Some complaints about Citi Bikes are not new: imbalances between stations that cause some docks to be full and others to be entirely empty; trouble docking bikes properly and getting overcharged; bikes getting vandalized and stolen. But what of the mechanics of the bike itself — squeaky brakes, flimsy pedals, tires losing air, all leading to a rider having to “pedal extra hard” to get smooth traction. Chatter about these mechanical issues on devoted bike subreddits <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/Citibike/comments/x9acsk/is_it_just_me_or_are_the_vast_majority_of_bikes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">r/Citibike</a> and <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/x92p3h/citibikes_are_in_a_dreadful_state_of_repair/r/NYCBikes"> r/NYCBikes </a> alleges that a “once-robust maintenance system has now been replaced by a team split into battery swappers and mechanics,” the majority of whom spend most of their time replacing batteries for e-bikes, whose updates and launches have been most pushed by the company in recent years.</p>

      <p> Tom Reingold, a resident in the West Village and avid Citi Bike rider, believes that while the growth of a biking system in the city is to be lauded, the average condition of the bike has gotten worse. </p>

      <p> "I am concerned because they [Citi Bike] have so much data they've collected that they may be making a cost-benefit analysis and they may decide a certain amount of broken-downness is tolerable," Reingold said. "To be fair, that's true and what is that amount?"</p>

      <p> Dan Rothblatt, a software engineer in the city also rides Citi Bike predominantly in the Upper West Side, agrees — the system has been a boon for the city, but comes with some frustrating mechanical issues that are yet to be solved. One in particular that bothers him is the handbraking system.</p>

      <p> "I don't know what's going on with it, but you brake on the bike and if you use both, there's this really loud, like, ear-piercing screech, like a pterodactyl attacking you," Rothblatt said. "It's really terrible."

      <p id="pterodactyl">"I don't know what's going on with it, but you brake on the bike and if you use both, there's this really loud, like, ear-piercing screech, like a pterodactyl attacking you. </p>



      <p> Rothblatt added that he finds public-private partnerships, such as the partnership between Citi Bike and the NYC Department of Transportation, generally murky to understand — particularly as the struggle between an entrenched system and its costs grows.</p>

      <p> "When they first rolled the e-bikes out, they were eight cents a minute and now they're 15, so nearly doubled in price," he said. "And you can say 'Oh, well that's because they've got more e-bikes and they need to maintain them' or whatever. But they aren't necessarily doing an incredible job maintaining them. So it seems like a lot of the price increases are going to shareholders."</p>

      <p> Patrice Delva and Kimberly Griffin, two bike mechanics at Citi Bike and union members at TWU Local 100, believe that increased reports or complaints also have to do with the growing pains that come with a system whose popularity increased through and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Griffin, who works in New York, says that about four of the 7.5 hours she works on an average day are devoted to fixing e-bikes and dead batteries and she fixes about 30 to 40 bikes a day. </p>

      <p> A hiring spree is on at Motivate, the company that operates Citi Bike, said Delva, and he estimates that 600 people have joined the union in recent years.</p>

      <p>"There is, of course, still the labor crunch, right?" said Delva. "There's still a difficulty in hiring good people and keeping them around. You know, we are always in debates about it with them [management] about certain things and policies that they could change to keep more people around."</p>



    <p> According to monthly <a href ="https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data/operating-reports"> operating reports</a>  published on the Citi Bike website, the definition and requirements of a bike maintenance check changed between July 2013 and July 2022. In July 2013, 100% of all bikes in the system had to receive a monthly mechanical check. By July 2015, that had changed to 95% of bikes being checked every month. From July 2017 to date, the maintenance check requirements read that "Every Bicycle that appears in the Bicycle Fleet level recording each day shall have received a Bicycle Maintenance check and cleaning within the last 45 Days." </p>
<br>
    <p id="checkdefinition">
     “Each bike check includes brake adjustment, gear/shifter adjustment, and chain and seatpost lubrication if necessary. The overall safety check includes the wheels, hubs, cranks, pedals, bottom bracket, lights, saddle bolts, seat clamp bushing, stem bolts, accessory bolts, handlebars, bollard attachment, kickstand, bell and chain.” </p>
<br>
<p> Griffin and Delva also said that customers should always report problems, minor or not. It is only when the urgent issues get flagged that mechanics get alerted to get out in the field and examine the problem, whether or not they catch it on their routine rounds.

          One of Delva's suggestions around the labor crunch is to stop labeling mechanics as seasonal workers and drop them in the winter-time, when ridership dips, with the promise to re-hire when business picks up. Training as a mechanic takes time, said Delva, and <strong> keeping workers for longer without the "seasonal" tag </strong>could help stem attrition from the company's mechanic workforce.</p></div>

              Griffin and Delva also said that <strong> customers should always report problems, minor or not. </strong> It is only when the urgent issues get flagged that mechanics get alerted to get out in the field and examine the problem, whether or not they catch it on their routine rounds. "Our first rule in the field is always safety," said Griffin. "Our job to make sure that we're doing a 21-point inspection correctly and make sure the bike is safe enough to ride. Not for us, but you know, just for the customers as well."</p>

              Citi Bike revenue ballooned to over $10 million in July 2022 — when they began operating in New York in 2013, they recorded a revenue of $4.9 million in July 2013, with an average fleet size of just over 5,000. Revenue comes from both membership and sponsorship fees. </p></div></div>
